You can use Element on its own as a functional test automation tool, but it really shines when you can reuse it for your load tests.

The easiest way to run Element scripts as load test scripts is to use [Flood](https://flood.io). Flood is a cloud-based distributed load testing platform that allows you to scale up your tests quickly, and it already supports Element scripts. All you have to do is upload your script to the Flood site and you'll be able to set test settings for your scenario. In this way you can quickly start running your script with as many users as you want from the cloud.

Check out the [Flood documentation on running Element scripts](https://help.flood.io/getting-started-with-load-testing/step-by-step-guide-flood-element) to get started!

Congratulations on finishing the guide to Element! You're now ready to start building your own projects based on this versatile tool. If you get stuck, we do have a few sample scripts in the [Tutorials](/docs/1.0/tutorials) section-- or you can always just [email us](mailto:support@flood.io).
